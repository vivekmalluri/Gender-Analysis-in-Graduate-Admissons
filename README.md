# Gender Bias in Graduate Admissions Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of gender bias in graduate admissions at the University of Berkeley using an in-built dataset in R. The project explores patterns and insights to understand the extent and nature of bias in the admissions process.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze admissions data to examine potential gender bias. This involves investigating acceptance rates across different departments and genders, visualizing trends, and performing statistical tests to validate findings. The insights derived from this analysis can help:

- Identify areas where gender bias might exist.
- Provide recommendations to improve fairness in the admissions process.
- Contribute to broader discussions on gender equity in education.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Utilizing the built-in R dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing and visualizing acceptance rates by gender and department.
- **Statistical Testing:** Applying tests like Chi-square to assess the significance of observed trends.
- **Insight Derivation:** Generating actionable conclusions from the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the built-in `UCBAdmissions` dataset in R. It includes:
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Admission Status (Admitted/Rejected)
- Department (A, B, C, etc.)



## Usage
1. **Data Exploration:** Use the `gender_bias_analysis.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset and visualize trends.
2. **Statistical Testing:** Perform statistical tests included in the notebook to validate findings.
3. **Results:** Check the `results/` folder for visualizations and summarized findings.

## Dependencies
Key libraries and tools used in this project include:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- jupyter

Full dependency list is available in `requirements.txt`.

## Results and Insights
Some key findings from the analysis:
- Gender distribution varies significantly across departments.
- Certain departments exhibit higher admission rates for one gender over the other.
- Statistical tests confirm that these differences are significant in some cases, suggesting potential bias.
